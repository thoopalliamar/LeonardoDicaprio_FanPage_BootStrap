        <p>Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born on November 11, 1974, in Los Angeles. He is the only child of Irmelin (née Indenbirken),
          a legal secretary, and George DiCaprio, an underground comix artist and producer and distributor of comic books.
          DiCaprio's father is of Italian (from Alife) and German (from Bavaria) descent. DiCaprio's maternal grandfather,
          Wilhelm Indenbirken, was German. His maternal grandmother, Helene Indenbirken (born Yelena Smirnova; 1915–2008),was
          a Russian-born German citizen.In an interview in Russia, DiCaprio referred to himself as "half-Russian" and said
          that two of his grandparents were Russian.DiCaprio's parents met while attending college and subsequently moved
          to Los Angeles, California.</p>

        <p>DiCaprio was named Leonardo because his pregnant mother was looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in the Uffizi
          museum in Florence, Italy, when he first kicked. His parents separated when he was a year old, and he lived mostly
          with his mother. The two lived in several Los Angeles neighborhoods, such as Echo Park and Los Feliz (his Los Feliz
          residence was later converted into a public library), while his mother worked several jobs. DiCaprio attended Seeds
          Elementary School (now UCLA Lab School) and John Marshall High School a few blocks away, after attending the Los
          Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years. He dropped out of high school following his third year, eventually
          earning his general equivalency diploma (GED). DiCaprio spent part of his childhood in Germany with his maternal
          grandparents, Wilhelm and Helene. He is conversant in German and Italian.</p>

        <p>DiCaprio was also a contestant on the children's game show Fun House. One of the stunts he performed on the show
          was going fishing in a small pool of water by catching the fish only with his teeth.</p>
